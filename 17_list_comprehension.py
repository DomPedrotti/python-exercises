# Exercise 2 - create a variable named capitalized_fruits and use list comprehension syntax to produce output 
# like ['Mango', 'Kiwi', 'Strawberry', etc...]

# Exercise 10 - Make a variable named even_numbers that holds only the even numbers

# Exercise 17 - Make a variable named numbers_plus_5. In it, return a list containing each number plus five.

# BONUS Make a variable named "primes" that is a list containing the prime numbers in the numbers list. *Hint* 
# you may want to make or find a helper function that determines if a given number is prime or not.
